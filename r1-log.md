### R1D2
Reworked my #nodejs mini server app to a #go #golang powered app and realised how much I got used to javascript's lack of typesafety. Took me some time! (Never worked with Go before)

* go run start.go

### R1D3
My #go #golang backend is now able to serve html and css files. Decided to quit working on the app for now, started an advanced #webdev tutorial by @AndreiNeagoie and already had some eureka moments regarding #ssh and #rsa. https://www.udemy.com/share/1009OgAEcccV9TR3g=/

### R1D4
No coding today but completed the 1st performance optimization part of the advanced #webdev course I started yesterday. Tomorrow I will dive into #React again after a few months of abstinence.

### R1D5
Got into #redux today and learned that it is based on #flux pattern and can be used in other UI layers such as #vuejs! (I like #MobX simplicity though üòá) Will have a look into Context API & Hooks based on 
@dceddia articles tomorrow. https://daveceddia.com/archives/

### R1D6
Rewrote my app again and substituted #redux with state management based on React's context API and Hooks. Works like charm following this tutorial by @develop_simply https://link.medium.com/aLzWYbn2qV

I now have the same mini app running on MobX, Redux and Context API for comparison. Might add a new Github repository tomorrow. :)

### R1D7
Took a small (but highly overdue) journey into #javascript bundlers like #webpack and set up an example mini app. Realised that it is never good to just use things without at least understanding them in a basic way. Will have a look into #parcel and #rollup later.

### R1D8
Working on the advanced #webdev course frontend performance optimization chapter.

Resources:
webpagetest.org

React CSS Styling:
- tailwind?
- glamorous
- styled components
- css modules

### R1D9
Working further on the advanced #webdev course frontend performance optimization chapter.
- Code splitting with asnyc components
React components rerender when their parents update (but this is not always necessary and a performance decreaser)
- PureComponent: only updates when received props change (but warning: it's not a deep comparison and will not properly work with complicated data props)
- shouldComponentUpdate: can be used alternatively, but is a more safe way
- why-did-you-update library!
- check React app performance: http://localhost:3000/?react_perf

### R1D10
Covered an important topic today: Progressive Web Apps and their pros and cons. Also I started working on a relaunch of my website and blog, including a move to @digitalocean!

### R1D11
I tortured myself with webserver (#apache) configuration today, while moving domains and webspaces around providers and still not everything works properly. I'm now following an old programmer's rule: Stop when stuck and continue later (in my case tomorrow morning) with a fresh mind. 

### R1D12
Finalized move of my website and blog to digitalocean.com!

### R1D13
Set up Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate, PWA installation for blog and website; digged into Testing and Behaviour Driven Development

Resources:
- Jasmine
- Jest (must popular!)
- Mocha
- Chai (language chains)
- Karma.js (only test runner)
- Sinon.js (mock, spies and stubs (e.g. make fake server))
- Istanbul (test coverage and where missing tests are)
- Tape, Ava
- Enzyme (esp. for React)

### R1D14
R1D014 #100DaysOfCode: Today I started working on a topic I've been neglecting for a long time: Testing in (#frontend) web development. üôÑ I started with some insights in #jest. Hope to find out more about the "when, what and whys" instead of the "how" to test!

 - React components are pure functions and are easily tested with unit tests
 - integration tests test connections between components (e.g. API calls)
 - automation tests (= end-to-end-tests) are UI user tests (Nighwatch, WebDriverIO, TestCafe, CyPress) --> very expensive to implement

 ### R1D15
R1D15 #100DaysOfCode: More #jest #javascript testing today including async tests, assertions and mockups. Tomorrow will be about testing #react with #enzyme.
Resources:
 https://github.com/sapegin/jest-cheat-sheet

### R1D16
R1D16 #100DaysOfCode: Didn't have too much fun with more testing on #react today so I will move on and start with learning #typescript from tomorrow.

Enzyme:
  - shallow: renders the component without child components
  - mount: full DOM rendering
  - render: renders to static HTML (cheerio lib)
  yarn test -- --coverage

### R1D17
  - dynamic (Python, Ruby, JS, PHP, ..)/static (C, C#, Java, Scala) programming languages
  - static types must be declared!
    var a = 100; vs. int a;

  - strong/weak programming languages (type coercion is the process of converting value from one type to another -> strong langs don't do that )

  - Flow is compiled to JS with Babel, which compiles to ES5; ReasonML, Elm, Typescript have their own compiler

### R1D18
My baby girl took much of my attention the last two days, so progress on working on #typescript was slow but still steady. #100DaysOfCode üí™

init TypeScript project: tsc --init
compile .ts file to .js: tsc app.ts (--watch)

### R1D19
R1D19 #100DaysOfCode: Started working on #typescript in #react and did not feel very comfortable with it. I should probably keep on learning tomorrow.

Resources:
- definitelytyped.org (add ts to js-based 3rd party libraries like react)
- https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript
- npx create-react-app my-app --typescript

### R1D20
No coding today.

### R1D21
R1D21 #100DaysOfCode: No "real" coding today but reading some #webdev newsletters and writing which resulted in two new short tutorials about #nodejs & #expressjs APIs for #postgresql on my weblog.
Resources

### R1D22
R1D22 #100DaysOfCode: Started working on server-side rendered web apps, which has been on my bucket list for months! Started my first Next.js project stumbled open @ReactStaticJS and @nestframework.. much to learn apparently!

Libraries like react-snapshot can be added to your project, used to generate HTML copies of your application pages and save them to a specified folder. You can then deploy this folder alongside your JS bundle. This way, the HTML will be served along with the response allowing your site to be accessible by users with JavaScript disabled, search engines etc.

Resources
- Gatsby.js
- Next.js
- ReactStaticJs
- Nest.js

### R1D23
R1D23 #100DaysOfCode: More coding on server-side rendered apps today! Read about #CRA vs. #Nextjs vs. #Gatsbyjs and still need to figure out which framework is great for specific use-cases.

### R1D24
R1D24 #100DaysOfCode: So I'm starting to convert my vanilla #HTML #CSS #JavaScript portfolio to a #Gatsbyjs powered #SSR website and I'm not yet sure if it is worth the massive boilerplate code that is added. Like the overall configuration experience though!

### R1D25
R1D25 #100DaysOfCode: WIP with Gatsby.js.

### R1D26 
R1D26 #100DaysOfCode: Almost done with the mini relaunch of my website with Gatsby.js. üßê There are still some responsiveness issues to solve and I should have a check with @____lighthouse. First thing tomorrow morning!

### R1D27
R1D27 #100DaysOfCode: I'm done rebuilding my website with @gatsbyjs and now it's time for some ice-cream. üôÇ

### R1D28
R1D28 #100DaysOfCode: Super excited to start a whole new chapter today: Writing an app with @electronjs and starting with the #react boilerplate. Maybe I test out the @hapijs framework as a backend service right away. 
"Track your mood!"

### R1D29
R1D29 #100DaysOfCode: I don't like it when the setup of my tech stack lasts so long I almost lose interest in actual coding üò¨ well, at least I'm done now starting my @electronjs project with Next.js, styled-components and UI library.

### R1D30
R1D30 #100DaysOfCode: Anyone feeling nostalgic tonight? üíô My fun @electronjs project looks like a Windows 95 software and I think it's adorable. 

### R1D31
More coding on @electronjs app.

### R1D32
R1D32 #100DaysOfCode: I finished my Node.js API powered by Hapi.js (not Express.js this time), CRUD actions and database connection today. I love the simplicity of lowdb for experimenting and fast prototyping.

### R1D33
R1D33 #100DaysOfCode: Okay, back to the serious stuff now after I have finished my @electronjs daily mood tracker fun app today ((link: https://github.com/gitfrosh/track-ur-mood) github.com/gitfrosh/track‚Ä¶).

### R1D35
Wow, time moves fast during the #100DaysOfCode and my to-do list is still long covering topics like server-side rendering, web components and React styling libs. 
Also I'm still working on @andreineagoie|s #webdev course on #udemy and @svelte keeps popping up everywhere lately..

### R1D36
R1D36 #100DaysOfCode: Unfortunately, only minimal coding today: Read about @svelte and set up the sapper example app: https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template. Tomorrow I'll keep working on it.

### R1D37
R1D37 #100DaysOfCode: I started a fun project with @svelte today, played around with some open APIs and even tried out some #python web scraping. Will deploy tomorrow :)
