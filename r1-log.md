### R1D2
Reworked my #nodejs mini server app to a #go #golang powered app and realised how much I got used to javascript's lack of typesafety. Took me some time! (Never worked with Go before)

* go run start.go

### R1D3
My #go #golang backend is now able to serve html and css files. Decided to quit working on the app for now, started an advanced #webdev tutorial by @AndreiNeagoie and already had some eureka moments regarding #ssh and #rsa. https://www.udemy.com/share/1009OgAEcccV9TR3g=/

### R1D4
No coding today but completed the 1st performance optimization part of the advanced #webdev course I started yesterday. Tomorrow I will dive into #React again after a few months of abstinence.

### R1D5
R1D5 #100DaysOfCode: Got into #redux today and learned that it is based on #flux pattern and can be used in other UI layers such as #vuejs! (I like #MobX simplicity though ðŸ˜‡) Will have a look into Context API & Hooks based on 
@dceddia articles tomorrow. https://daveceddia.com/archives/

### R1D6
R1D6 #100DaysOfCode: Rewrote my app again and substituted #redux with state management based on React's context API and Hooks. Works like charm following this tutorial by @develop_simply https://link.medium.com/aLzWYbn2qV

I now have the same mini app running on MobX, Redux and Context API for comparison. Might add a new Github repository tomorrow. :)

### R1D7
R1D7 #100DaysOfCode: Took a small (but highly overdue) journey into #javascript bundlers like #webpack and set up an example mini app. Realised that it is never good to just use things without at least understanding them in a basic way. Will have a look into #parcel and #rollup later.
