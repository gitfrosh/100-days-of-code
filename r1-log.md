### R1D2
Reworked my #nodejs mini server app to a #go #golang powered app and realised how much I got used to javascript's lack of typesafety. Took me some time! (Never worked with Go before)

* go run start.go

### R1D3
My #go #golang backend is now able to serve html and css files. Decided to quit working on the app for now, started an advanced #webdev tutorial by @AndreiNeagoie and already had some eureka moments regarding #ssh and #rsa. https://www.udemy.com/share/1009OgAEcccV9TR3g=/

### R1D4
No coding today but completed the 1st performance optimization part of the advanced #webdev course I started yesterday. Tomorrow I will dive into #React again after a few months of abstinence.
